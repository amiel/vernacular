{"name":"Vernacular","tagline":"A half-baked library to make common WordPress tasks less painful","body":"# Vernacular\r\n\r\n## What the heck?\r\n\r\nDeveloping themes with WordPress can be frustrating; WordPress often makes it difficult to write clean, readable code.\r\n\r\nVernacular aims to provide a consistent, clear, object-oriented interface on top of WordPress to make creating WordPress themes more productive and more fun. It covers common tasks like custom post queries, cropping images, registered custom post types and taxonomies, and creating custom widgets.\r\n\r\n### Are you sure that's a good idea? Is more abstraction really the answer?\r\n\r\nNot entirely, and maybe.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nTo start with Vernacular, just [download](https://github.com/nathancarnes/vernacular/archive/master.zip), unzip to your theme's directory, and include this line in your `functions.php`:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nrequire_once('vernacular/bootstrap.php');\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nDocumentation is still a work in progress, but take a look at our [wiki](https://github.com/nathancarnes/vernacular/wiki/_pages) for the latest/greatest.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1. Fork it\r\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\r\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)\r\n4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\r\n5. Create new Pull Request\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
